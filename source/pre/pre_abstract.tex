Software quality assurance is important for adding value to users who use it. One of the phases to obtain this quality is Software Testing. The software testing can be applied at different levels and using different techniques. The proposal to increase the reliability of the software is the application of testing techniques, can be functional or structural or based on errors (Mutation). Often the techniques can be applied in a complementary way, since there is no technique that is able to cover all aspects of the system. This paper contains a case study of real software, where the techniques functional testing criteria and mutant testing are applied in a Relational Database Application. (RDA) We present the theoretical contextualisation necessary to understand the case study, applied techniques and a general analysis of the results obtained. This work contributes to the understanding and practice of testing techniques in the RDA.
